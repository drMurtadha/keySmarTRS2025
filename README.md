# From Sensors to Sustainability: Reliable Data Pipelines for Heritage and Infrastructure Resilience
## Abstract

Modern infrastructure and heritage assets share a fundamental challenge: the need for reliability under environmental stress and data uncertainty. As IoT sensors, remote-sensing platforms, and AI models increasingly underpin maintenance decision-making, the reliability of data pipelines, from acquisition to analytics, defines the resilience of the physical systems they monitor. This keynote presents an end-to-end framework that integrates heterogeneous sensors, cloud-edge analytics, and explainable machine learning to derive actionable insights for both heritage buildings and modern infrastructure. Emphasis is placed on fault-tolerant data ingestion, adaptive model retraining to mitigate sensor drift, and reliability metrics that translate computational confidence into engineering trust. Case studies in heritage microclimate monitoring illustrate how interpretable models and rule-based scoring enhance sustainability decisions while aligning with reliability standards in smart infrastructure. The session concludes with design guidelines for AI-enabled monitoring systems that are verifiable, maintainable, and sustainable, highlighting the core principles for driving the future with intelligent and resilient technologies.
